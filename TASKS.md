### Technical Take-Home Assessment: Online Bookstore Application

#### Task Description:

You are tasked with developing an online bookstore application. The application should allow users to browse books, search for books by title or author, and view book details. As a bonus, users should be able to register an account and log in, add books to their "favorites" list, and manage their "favorites" list.

#### Requirements:

1. **Frontend Development:**

  - Implement a responsive web interface using React.
  - Design intuitive user interfaces for browsing books, searching for books by title or author, and viewing book details.

2. **Backend Development:**

  - Implement CRUD operations for managing and browsing books, as well as viewing book details.
  - Integrate with a database of your choice to store book data.
  - NOTE: We ask that you do not use Next.js for this assessment. Any other backend framework is fine.

3. **Database Design:**

  - Design an appropriate database schema to store information about books.

4. **Additional Features:**

  - Implement validation and error handling on both the frontend and backend to ensure data integrity and provide a smooth user experience.
  - Allow for the entire project to be stood up using a single Docker Compose command.

5. **Bonus Points:**
  - Implement user authentication for login and registration functionalities (3rd party library/services are allowed).
  - Implement a "favorites" list where the user can save and manage their favorite books.
  - Verify your work with unit tests.
  - Use a monorepo build system to structure your project (hint: We are big fans of Nx).

#### Submission Guidelines:

- Zip your project and submit the zip via [LiquidFiles](https://liquidfiles.atomicplays.com/filedrop/EmployeeAssessments).
- Provide documentation outlining the architecture, design decisions, and any additional information necessary to understand and evaluate the application.
- Include a README.md file with instructions on how to run the application and any assumptions made during development.

#### Evaluation Criteria:

- Code quality, organization, and adherence to best practices.
- Functionality completeness and correctness according to the provided requirements.
- User interface design, usability, and responsiveness.
- Database design and efficiency.
- Clarity and completeness of documentation.
- Whether the entire project can be stood up using a single Docker Compose command.
